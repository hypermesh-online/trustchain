## Production Deployment Strategy

### QA Conditional Approval Terms

**Phase 1: Limited Deployment (Weeks 1-2)**
- Deploy with performance monitoring
- Limited user base (internal/beta)
- Focus on stability validation
- Collect real-world metrics

**Phase 2: Optimization Sprint (Weeks 3-4)**
- Address STOQ bottleneck (2.95 Gbps ‚Üí 40 Gbps target)
- Performance tuning based on Phase 1 metrics
- Scale testing with increased load

**Phase 3: Full Production (Week 5+)**
- Complete rollout pending Phase 2 success
- Multi-region deployment
- Full user migration

### Deployment Requirements

- **IPv6-only infrastructure** - No IPv4 fallback
- **TrustChain CA certificates** - For all components
- **Byzantine-tolerant nodes** - Minimum 4 nodes (3f+1)
- **Performance monitoring** - Real-time metrics collection

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/web3-ecosystem.git
cd web3-ecosystem
