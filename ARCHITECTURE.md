# TrustChain Architecture

## Design Philosophy

**TrustChain is the minimal foundation layer** that provides:
- **Certificate Authority (CA)**: Root trust and certificate issuance
- **Certificate Transparency (CT)**: Public audit logs for all certificates  
- **DNS Resolution**: Secure namespace resolution with certificate validation
- **Asset Management**: Minimal resource tracking for CA/CT operations ONLY
- **Bootstrap Service**: Self-bootstrapping to solve circular dependencies

**What TrustChain is NOT**:
- ❌ Full VM execution environment (that's HyperMesh)
- ❌ Complex asset orchestration (that's HyperMesh)
- ❌ Blockchain consensus (that's HyperMesh)
- ❌ Application hosting (that's HyperMesh)

## Circular Dependency Solution

### The Problem
```
HyperMesh → needs DNS resolution → TrustChain
TrustChain → needs blockchain consensus → HyperMesh
Both → need secure transport → STOQ
STOQ → needs certificate validation → TrustChain
```

### Bootstrap Chain Solution
```
Phase 0: Traditional Bootstrap
├── trust.hypermesh.online (traditional DNS)
├── Self-signed root CA
├── Basic STOQ transport
└── Manual service discovery

Phase 1: Self-Contained TrustChain
├── Full CA/CT/DNS implementation  
├── STOQ with TrustChain certificates
├── Minimal asset tracking (certs, keys, policies)
└── No blockchain dependencies

Phase 2: HyperMesh Integration
├── Blockchain consensus for CA decisions
├── HyperMesh VM for complex assets
├── Byzantine CT logs
└── Full asset orchestration in HyperMesh

Phase 3: Global Federation  
├── Namespace takeover from traditional DNS
├── Cross-federation with other instances
├── Full decentralization
└── Production deployment
```

## Component Architecture

### 1. Certificate Authority (CA)
- **Root CA**: Self-signed bootstrap → federated consensus
- **Intermediate CAs**: Hierarchical trust delegation
- **Certificate Issuance**: Automated with policy enforcement
- **Key Management**: HSM integration for root keys

### 2. Certificate Transparency (CT)
- **CT Logs**: Public append-only logs of all certificates
- **Log Verification**: Merkle tree validation
- **Monitor Network**: Automated certificate discovery
- **Audit Framework**: Compliance and suspicious activity detection

### 3. DNS Resolution
- **Authoritative DNS**: Owns trust.hypermesh.online namespace
- **Recursive Resolver**: Secure resolution with certificate pinning
- **DNS-over-QUIC**: Encrypted resolution using STOQ transport
- **Security Validation**: Every response cryptographically verified

### 4. Minimal Asset System
**TrustChain assets are ONLY CA/CT resources:**
```yaml
# TrustChain Asset Types
assets:
  certificates:
    - root_ca_cert
    - intermediate_ca_certs
    - server_certificates
    - client_certificates
  
  keys:
    - root_private_key (HSM)
    - intermediate_private_keys
    - signing_keys
  
  policies:
    - certificate_policies
    - ct_log_policies
    - dns_security_policies
  
  ct_logs:
    - transparency_logs
    - audit_trails
    - compliance_records
```

### 5. Bootstrap Service
- **Phase Detection**: Automatically determines current bootstrap phase
- **Self-Initialization**: Can bootstrap without external dependencies
- **Health Monitoring**: Validates all services are operational
- **Upgrade Path**: Manages transitions between bootstrap phases

## Integration Points

### STOQ Transport Integration
```rust
// TrustChain uses STOQ for all network communication
pub struct TrustChainTransport {
    stoq: Arc<Stoq>,
    certificates: Arc<CertificateManager>,
}

impl TrustChainTransport {
    // DNS-over-QUIC resolution
    pub async fn resolve_dns(&self, query: &DnsQuery) -> Result<DnsResponse>;
    
    // Certificate validation using CT logs
    pub async fn validate_certificate(&self, cert: &Certificate) -> Result<bool>;
    
    // Secure service discovery
    pub async fn discover_service(&self, service: &str) -> Result<ServiceEndpoint>;
}
```

### HyperMesh Integration Points
```rust
// TrustChain provides certificates TO HyperMesh
pub trait TrustChainProvider {
    // Certificate issuance for HyperMesh nodes
    async fn issue_node_certificate(&self, node_id: &NodeId) -> Result<Certificate>;
    
    // DNS resolution for HyperMesh services
    async fn resolve_hypermesh_service(&self, service: &str) -> Result<ServiceEndpoint>;
    
    // Certificate transparency logging
    async fn log_certificate(&self, cert: &Certificate) -> Result<CTLogEntry>;
}

// HyperMesh provides blockchain consensus TO TrustChain
pub trait HyperMeshConsensus {
    // Consensus for CA policy decisions
    async fn validate_ca_policy(&self, policy: &CAPolicy) -> Result<bool>;
    
    // Blockchain-based CT log consensus
    async fn commit_ct_entry(&self, entry: &CTLogEntry) -> Result<BlockHash>;
    
    // Federated trust decisions
    async fn validate_trust_anchor(&self, anchor: &TrustAnchor) -> Result<bool>;
}
```

## Security Model

### Zero Trust Foundation
1. **Every connection** verified with certificates
2. **Every certificate** logged in CT
3. **Every CT log** validated by consensus
4. **Every DNS response** cryptographically signed
5. **Every service** authenticated bidirectionally

### Trust Bootstrap Chain
```
Self-Signed Root CA
├── trust.hypermesh.online server cert
├── STOQ transport certificates  
├── DNS signing keys
└── CT log signing certificates

Federated Root CA (Phase 2+)
├── HyperMesh blockchain consensus
├── Multi-party key generation
├── Distributed trust anchors
└── Cross-federation validation
```

## Deployment Architecture

### Phase 0: Traditional Bootstrap
```yaml
# IPv6-ONLY DNS records (NO IPv4 support)
trust.hypermesh.online:
  AAAA: 2001:db8::10
  
# Service endpoints with STOQ integration
ca.trust.hypermesh.online: "quic://[2001:db8::10]:8443/ca"
ct.trust.hypermesh.online: "quic://[2001:db8::10]:8443/ct" 
dns.trust.hypermesh.online: "quic://[2001:db8::10]:853"

# Certificate configuration
certificates:
  bootstrap_mode: "self_signed_localhost_only"
