## Overview
This specification defines the certificate architecture for the entire Web3 ecosystem, ensuring consistent certificate management, validation, and consensus across all components.

## Certificate Authority (TrustChain) Requirements

### Core CA Functionality
- **Root CA**: Self-signed for bootstrap â†’ federated consensus for production
- **Certificate Issuance**: Automated with policy enforcement
- **Certificate Rotation**: 24-hour intervals with zero downtime
- **Certificate Validation**: Real-time with CT log verification
- **Trust Anchors**: HSM-protected root keys in production

### Certificate Transparency Integration
- **Consensus Engine**: NKrypt ConsensusProof (PoSpace + PoStake + PoWork + PoTime)
- **Log Storage**: Block-matrix architecture with O(log n) complexity
- **Validation Interval**: Sub-second real-time monitoring
- **Byzantine Tolerance**: Multi-proof validation prevents tampering

## STOQ Transport Certificate Requirements

### Mandatory Certificate Properties
- **Certificate Source**: TrustChain CA-issued (NO self-signed in production)
- **Common Names**: Node-specific with server name validation
- **Key Type**: Ed25519 (production) / RSA-4096 (bootstrap)
- **Validity Period**: 24 hours maximum
- **Transport Security**: QUIC with mandatory TLS 1.3

### Certificate Lifecycle Management
```rust
pub struct StoqNodeCertificate {
    pub node_id: String,
    pub certificate: Certificate,
    pub private_key: PrivateKey,
    pub issued_at: SystemTime,
    pub expires_at: SystemTime,
    pub fingerprint_sha256: [u8; 32],
    pub consensus_proof: ConsensusProof,  // NKrypt validation
}
```

### Real-time Validation Requirements
- **Certificate Fingerprinting**: SHA-256 fingerprints for all certificates
- **CT Log Verification**: Real-time validation against transparency logs
- **Consensus Validation**: NKrypt ConsensusProof verification
- **Chain Validation**: Full certificate chain verification to root CA

## Network Requirements

### IPv6-Only Transport
- **Protocol**: QUIC over IPv6 exclusively
- **No IPv4 Support**: Complete removal of dual-stack networking
- **Address Format**: Full IPv6 addressing with proper routing
- **Migration**: All existing IPv4 references must be removed

### Security Standards
- **TLS Version**: TLS 1.3 minimum (QUIC requirement)
- **Cipher Suites**: Modern cryptography only
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Required for all connections
- **Certificate Pinning**: Mandatory for critical services

## Consensus Requirements (NKrypt Integration)

### Four-Proof Consensus Architecture
```rust
pub struct ConsensusProof {
    pub stake_proof: StakeProof,    // WHO owns/validates
    pub time_proof: TimeProof,      // WHEN it occurred  
    pub space_proof: SpaceProof,    // WHERE it's stored
    pub work_proof: WorkProof,      // WHAT computational work
}
```

### Validation Requirements
- **Consensus Validation**: All certificate operations require ConsensusProof
- **Byzantine Tolerance**: Withstand 1/3 malicious nodes
- **Temporal Ordering**: TimeProof prevents replay attacks
- **Storage Verification**: SpaceProof ensures certificate persistence

## Phase-Based Implementation

### Phase 0: Localhost Test Mode
```yaml
test_mode:
  ca_endpoint: "https://localhost:8443/ca"
  ct_endpoint: "https://localhost:8443/ct"
  dns_endpoint: "quic://localhost:853"
  trust_anchor: "self_signed_root_ca.pem"
  validation_mode: "permissive"
```

### Phase 1: Production Deployment
```yaml
production_mode:
  ca_endpoint: "https://trust.hypermesh.online:8443/ca"
  ct_endpoint: "https://trust.hypermesh.online:8443/ct"
  dns_endpoint: "quic://trust.hypermesh.online:853"
  trust_anchor: "hypermesh_root_ca.pem"
  validation_mode: "strict"
```

## Implementation Standards

### Certificate Request Process
1. **Node Authentication**: STOQ node requests certificate from TrustChain CA
2. **Identity Validation**: CA validates node identity and permissions
3. **Certificate Issuance**: CA issues certificate with embedded consensus proof
4. **CT Log Entry**: Certificate automatically logged in transparency logs
5. **Real-time Validation**: Certificate validated against CT logs and consensus

### Error Handling Requirements
- **Certificate Expiry**: Automatic renewal before expiration
- **Validation Failures**: Graceful degradation with security logging
- **Network Partitions**: Offline certificate validation capabilities
- **Byzantine Failures**: Detection and isolation of malicious nodes

## Success Criteria

### Performance Targets
- **Certificate Issuance**: < 5 seconds end-to-end
- **Validation Latency**: < 1 second for real-time verification
- **CT Log Updates**: < 10 seconds for transparency log entries
- **Consensus Finality**: < 30 seconds for Byzantine consensus

### Security Targets
- **Zero Unauthorized Certificates**: No invalid certificates in production
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All certificate operations logged immutably
- **Byzantine Resilience**: System functional with 33% malicious nodes
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: All communications protected against future compromise

## Migration Requirements

### From Current State
- **Replace self-signed certificates** with TrustChain CA-issued certificates
- **Remove IPv4 networking** and implement IPv6-only transport
- **Add consensus validation** to all certificate operations
- **Implement real-time monitoring** for certificate transparency

### Documentation Updates Required
- Update all component documentation to reference TrustChain integration
- Remove references to self-signed certificates for production use
- Add NKrypt consensus requirements to all specifications
- Update testing procedures for localhost vs production modes
